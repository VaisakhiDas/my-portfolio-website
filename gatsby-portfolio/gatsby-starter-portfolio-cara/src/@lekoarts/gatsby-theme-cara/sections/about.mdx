## About

> Hey there! I'm Vaisakhi Das, a Computer Science engineering student with a passion for building, breaking, and occasionally fixing things on the web.

I love crafting interactive websites, experimenting with code, and turning caffeine into cool digital experiences. Whether it's front-end design or backend logic, I enjoy exploring the full stack and learning something new every day.

My journey in tech started with curiosity and YouTube tutorials, and now it's growing with every project I build, bug I squash, and idea I prototype. I believe in clean code, creative thinking, and late-night debugging with a side of music.
